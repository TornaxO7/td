# td

`td` is a graph-based TUI todo app. It allows you to create tasks and define dependency
relationships between them. This way you can see which tasks can be worked on right now, and which
tasks still have unfinished prerequisite tasks.

`td` is still in development and while basic functionality is present, it is still very unpolished
(it is not v0.1 yet). See `todo.json` (or open it in `td`!) to see some of the remaining tasks.
